    <h2>A brief biography</h2>
      <p>My name is Nick Jacoby. I'm from a small ski town by the name of Maple Falls, WA located in the heart of Whatcom County. I know what you're thinking, and the answer to your question is no. I did not grow up skiing all of the time. Instead, I dreamed of getting out of that town and moving to the big city, which is what's brought me to the great city of Seattle. I've lived here for 7 years with no intention of moving anytime soon."<p>
